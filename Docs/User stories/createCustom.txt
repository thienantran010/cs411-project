As a logged in user (see login.txt), I can browse through images and enter a caption manually to create my own meme to my liking. A meme will be generated with the custom caption and chosen image. I will be shown the meme after it is generated. Upon creating the meme, it automatically appears in my profile, and I cannot delete or edit the meme. I can always access the meme by accessing my own profile’s Creation History, as well as save it to my device storage. Under the post, there will be a note stating “Custom Creation”.
