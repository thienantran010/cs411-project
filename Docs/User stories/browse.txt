After my first Custom Creation, I have access to the public sharing page, where I can see other works from different users. I can browse other users’ memes and like their posts, as well as view each users’ profile and their subsequent posts. I have the ability to sort all the posts based on different statistics such as most popular, most recent/new, most liked, etc.. The like function acts as a saving function, wherein my liked posts will be stored in a separate section attributed to my profile.
