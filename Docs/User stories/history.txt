As a logged in user (see login.txt), I can view past creations (random or custom), ready for me to access whenever I need it. They will appear under my profile, and I can view other people’s creation history by accessing their profile solely through their uploads. Attached to the post is the date of creation, as well as the number of likes attributed to the post based on other users’ interactions. I cannot delete the posts as part of my creation history.
