As a logged in user (see login.txt), I can enter a word or phrase and a meme will be generated and shown to me. The meme should have a caption of a quote and an image of anime from the api. Upon creating the meme, it automatically appears in my profile, and I cannot delete or edit the meme. I can always access the meme by accessing my own profile’s Creation History, as well as save it to my device storage. Under the post, there will be a note stating “Random Creation”.
