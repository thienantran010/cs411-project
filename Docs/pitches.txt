1. The app will use Spotify API and News API to pair a playlist of songs with a news 
article. The app will use sentiment analysis to correlate the article to songs
of similar sentiment. This can be done by searching the sentiment in spotify and selecting the first
playlist. 

2. The user will type in a word or phrase. We will use waifu.pics API to get pictures 
and quoteable quotes api to get quotes, prioritizing pics and quotes
correlated with that word or phrase. We will make a meme out of the picture and 
quote for the user using meme maker api and deliver it as an image.
